# Crunchyroll Playback Speed Controller Chrome Extension

Crunchyroll's default video player doesn't have the settings to change the playback speed, even though the ui elements is still there, created this Chrome extension to change that. Plus I like to watch videos in double speed. 

## Set up
1. Clone this repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dfan001/crunchyroll-playback-speed.git
```
2. Turn on developer mode on chrome
* Go to `chrome://extensions` on Chrome.
* Toggle on the `Developer mode` switch.

3. Add the extension to chrome
* Click `LOAD UNPACK` and select the `crunchy-playback-speed` directory.

4. Go to any videos on Crunchyroll's site and enjoy.
